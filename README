This is a module that allows users to create live documents for their projects. The module is based on the JISC project management workflow and templates. 

The aim of this module is to save time for users and allow them to create documentation for projects without having to make changes across all documents for data that occurs throughout different templates (e.g. risks, phases etc.).
